Chatbot Answer Evaluation Website
This project involves developing a chatbot answer evaluation website with the following architecture:
*   Frontend: Next.js with Shadcn UI
*   Backend: FastAPI
The website will feature two main sections:
1.  Dashboard: Provides an overview of evaluation results.
2.  Form Site: Enables users to submit chatbot questions and answers for evaluation.
Form Site Details:
The form site will include a set of 20 predefined questions. Additionally, users will have the option to dynamically generate more questions (e.g., safety-related questions) based on specific criteria using a "plus" button.
Users can copy and paste a question and its corresponding answer from a chatbot. They will then provide a manual, ground-truth answer for comparison. The submitted answers will be judged by two distinct evaluators:
1.  ML/NLP-based Evaluator: Utilizes machine learning and natural language processing techniques to assess the chatbot's answer.
2.  Gemini Agent Evaluator: A Gemini-powered agent that will judge the chatbot's answer and compare it against the manual answer based on predefined criteria.

than all the evaluations will be added to the dashboard in form of cool infographics .. confident-ai.com competitor 

IMPORTANT : This is  a rapid prototype demo .. so no db , redis , docker etc
